The rise_set package provides Python routines for finding the positions of
astronomical bodies to reasonable precision. It can be used to calculate target
uptime and sunrise, sunset and twilight times, accurate to 30s-1m.

The code uses Fortran SLALIB for the heavy lifting. The rise/set/transit algorithms
here are implementations of Astronomical Algorithms, Ch. 14 (Jean Meeus).

****Use this library at your own risk! This library is an alpha support library for
the LCOGT scheduling system. The API is volatile, not particularly pleasant, and
subject to change without notice.****

v.0.3.4  - Added calc_local_sidereal_time
v.0.3.5  - Bug fix for hour angles when user window has a time component (thanks Jason Eastman)
v.0.3.6  - Fix for incorrect exception handler in elem_to_topocentric_apparent. 
         - Fix incorrect case in initial element dictionary which resulted in 'Name' and 'name' being created
         - Fix handling of multi-opposition/year orbits in read_neocp_orbit.
         - Dump the elements out if we raise a MovingViolation exception (all above by Tim Lister)
v.0.3.7  - Add comet support.
         - Fix bug in gregorian_to_ut_mjd where fractional seconds were ignored (all above by Tim Lister)

           read_neocp_orbit(). Add docstring to date_to_tdb() (Tim Lister)
v.0.3.12 - Fix to correctly calculate hour angle limit intervals. (Curtis McCully)
v.0.3.13 - Added function for getting airmasses for times for a target and observer, calculate_airmass_for_times
v.0.3.14 - Adds a satellite target type and modifies Visibility to check for that target type and just return
           dark intervals for it (do no rise_set calculations).
v.0.3.16 - Added moon rise/set functionality and a moon_distance constraint for target visibility intervals.
v.0.4.0  - Made python 3 compatible
