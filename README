The rise_set package provides Python routines for finding the positions of
astronomical bodies to reasonable precision. It can be used to calculate target
uptime and sunrise, sunset and twilight times, accurate to 30s-1m.

The code uses Fortran SLALIB for the heavy lifting. The rise/set/transit algorithms
here are implementations of Astronomical Algorithms, Ch. 14 (Jean Meeus).

****Use this library at your own risk! This library is an alpha support library for
the LCOGT scheduling system. The API is volatile, not particularly pleasant, and
subject to change without notice.****

Please report bugs to Eric Saunders (esaunders@lcogt.net). The issues page for this
