The rise_set package provides Python routines for finding the positions of
astronomical bodies to reasonable precision. It can be used to calculate target
uptime and sunrise, sunset and twilight times, accurate to 30s-1m.

The code uses Fortran SLALIB for the heavy lifting. The rise/set/transit algorithms
here are implementations of Astronomical Algorithms, Ch. 14 (Jean Meeus).

****Use this library at your own risk! This library is an alpha support library for
the LCOGT scheduling system. The API is volatile, not particularly pleasant, and
subject to change without notice.****

project is http://issues.lco.gtn/projects/show/python-rise-set.

v 0.2.4 - Remove logging configuration: should be handled by clients
        - Fixed broken unit tests due to botched string refactoring
v 0.2.3 - Correctly handle circumpolar stars
        - Fixed refraction at non-zero horizons
v 0.2.2 - Fix rise/set/transit in same day (#3473)
        - Implemented horizon argument for calc_rise_set
v 0.2.1 - Generalised Angle class (#2272)
        - Implemented proper motion support (#2272)
        - Fixed sign error in transit refinement code (#1993)
        - Fixed rounding errors for second overflow (#3166)
        - Fixed broken interpolation over 24 hr RA boundaries (#3165)
v 0.2.5 - Fixed broken circumpolar calculation for southern hemisphere objects (#5969)
v 0.2.6 - Support for memoization of Angle and Visibility objects
