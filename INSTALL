The rise_set package should be installed using the provided setup.py file. As well
as installation, this handles the Fortran SLALIB and pyslalib dependencies.

* You must have installed numpy before beginning this process.
* You must have a working Fortran compiler on your path. I use gfortran.


The steps are straightforward.

1) Grab the bundled source-code release:

wget http://pluto.lco.gtn/rise_set-VERSION.tar.gz


2) Extract the source:

tar xvzf rise_set-VERSION.tar.gz


3) cd into the top level:

cd rise_set-VERSION


4) Install. It is recommended you install this to a virtualenv. If you are not
installing to a virtualenv, then you probably want this to install to EPD. That
means running as root, and replacing the 'python' below with '/opt/epd/bin/python'
(or wherever you have EPD installed):

python setup.py install


5) Now, as a normal user (with EPD or preferred Python on your path), you should
be able to use the module. Try running the example script, found in this directory:

python example_rise_set.py


6) If that works, congratulations! You can delete the tarball and the unpacked
directory, and being using the package in your own code.
