The rise_set package should be installed using tox, but pip or setuptools are also supported. As well
as installation, this handles the Fortran SLALIB and pySLALIB dependencies. The pySLALIB module is packaged up on the build servers `http://buildsba/python/`

* You must have installed numpy before beginning this process unless you use tox
* You must have a working Fortran compiler on your path. I use gfortran.

The steps are straightforward.

[Install with Tox]

1) Run tox from this directory. (pip install tox first if necessary)

[Install with Pip]

1) First install numpy (pip install numpy)

2) Then run pip install -r requirements.pip

3) To run tests, rune pip install -r test_requirements.pip, followed by nosetests

[Install with Setuptools]

1) First install numpy (pip install numpy)

2) Run `python setup.py [develop|test|install]`

[Running Example]

python example_rise_set.py
